    <meta name="description" content= "Kanlungan is a safe space 'shelter' dedicated for people who might be lost in their pathway of life. Adorned in charming digital artwork and led by the fictional shapeshifting cat, Miskonasia, the website holds several little ephemeras in the daily â€” helpful quotes for the day with an originally written poem in the side, a post-it note station as fleeting as you allow it to be, and a bit of an 'achievements' section dictated by the amount of days you log in." />
